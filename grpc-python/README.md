# Python client

This gradle submodule holds example code for talking with the gRPC based `gCDM` server.
The following instructions will assist you in running the example script.

## Python environment setup

These instructions assume that Conda or Miniconda 3 is available on your system.
From the top level of the repository, execute the following commands to setup and activate the python environment:

~~~shell
conda env create -f ./grpc-python/environment.yml
conda activate cdm-grpc
~~~

That's it!

## Running the python example

First, make sure you are in the `cdm-grpc` Conda environment.
Next, make sure a local server is running for development.
See [gcdm-local/README.md](../gcdm-local/README.md#spin-up) for details.
Finally, from the top level of the repository, execute the example python script:

~~~sh
python .\grpc-python\src\main\python\gcdm_netcdf.py
~~~

You should see the following output:

~~~sh
response header:
    error:
    version: 0

        data:
            shape: [1]

When you are finished, be sure to tear-down the local server.
See [gcdm-local/README.md](../gcdm-local/README.md#tear-down) for details.
